ðŸ§  OOP Playground

A collection of small and simple Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) projects created during my learning journey.
Each project focuses on applying one or more OOP principles â€” such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction â€” through real-world inspired mini examples.

ðŸš€ Purpose

This repository serves as my personal practice space for mastering OOP concepts.
Itâ€™s not about complexity â€” itâ€™s about clarity, structure, and understanding how objects interact in clean code design.

ðŸ§© Topics Covered

Class and Object fundamentals

Constructors & Destructors

Inheritance and Method Overriding

Polymorphism

Encapsulation & Abstraction

File Handling (Object-based)

Simple Mini Projects (e.g., Library System, Bank Account, Student Management)
